# OS

This repository contains several small OS assignment projects. Each folder below is a separate assignment — see the README inside each folder for full details.

- `Bash_Chess_Demostrator` — shell scripts and Python tools for splitting, parsing, and simulating chess PGN games.
- `Offset_File_Operations` — C program and tests demonstrating offset-based file read/write operations.
- `Process_Management_Tournament` — C implementations that simulate a gladiator tournament and demonstrate process management concepts.
- `Recursive_Dircopy` — a C program (`backup.c`) that recursively copies directories and example test scripts.
- `Smart_Dir_Sync` — a C-based directory synchronization utility with example files in `example_src_dir`.
